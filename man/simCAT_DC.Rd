This data includes a list of length three. The first internal object is a data.frame of
the item pool consisting of 100 dichotomous items. The item parameters of the first 90 items were generated with
the IRT 2PL model and calibrated with the same model. However, the item parameters of the last 10 items were
generated with the IRT 3PL model but calibrated with the IRT 2PL model. The second internal object is the response
data set including a sparse response data set of 10,000 examinees for the items in the item pool.
The third internal object is the examinee's ability estimates for 10,000 examinees.
