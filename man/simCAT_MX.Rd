\format{
This data includes a list of length three. The first internal object is a data.frame of
the item pool consisting of 200 dichotomous items and 30 polytomous items. The dichotomous items were
calibrated with the IRT 3PL model and the polytomous items were calibrated with the generalized
partial credit model. All polytomous items have three score categories (i.e., 0, 1, 2). The second
internal object is the response data set including a sparse response data set of 30,000 examinees
for the items in the item pool. The third internal object is the examinee's ability estimates
for 30,000 examinees.
