# irtQ 0.1.0

- Initial release on CRAN

- The `irtQ` package is a successor of the `irtplay` package which was
  retracted from R CRAN due to the intellectual property (IP) violation.
  All issues of the IP violation have been clearly resolved in the
  `irtQ` package.

- Most of the functions the `irtQ` package are identical in appearance
  and functionality to those of `irtplay` package except a few functions
  (e.g., `shape_df()`, `est_score()`). However, the computing speed of
  several functions (e.g., `est_irt()`, `est_score()`, `lwrc()`) in the
  `irtQ` package are faster than the previous ones in the `irtplay`
  package. Read the documentation carefully prior to using the
  functions.
